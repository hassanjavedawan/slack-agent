## What is OpenViktor?

OpenViktor is a fully autonomous AI teammate that lives in Slack. It reads messages, runs tools, learns from your team, and takes action — without leaving the chat. Think of it as hiring an AI employee that actually integrates into how your team already works.

Built as an open-source alternative to Viktor.

## Features

**Agent Runtime** — Multi-provider LLM engine (Claude, GPT, Gemini) with automatic retries, cost tracking, and usage limits per workspace.

**20+ Built-in Tools** — File operations, bash execution, browser automation, git, grep, AI-powered search, Slack admin, image generation, and more. Every tool is sandboxed with a permission system.

**Persistent Memory** — Learns from your team's conversations. Accumulates knowledge over time and recalls it when relevant.

**Proactive Behaviors** — Scheduled heartbeats, workflow discovery, channel introductions, and onboarding DMs for new workspaces. It doesn't just respond — it initiates.

**Integrations** — Connects to GitHub, Linear, and 2,000+ apps via Pipedream. Add custom API integrations through natural language.

**Admin Dashboard** — Full management UI: monitor runs, inspect threads, manage tools, track usage and costs, configure integrations.

**Multi-Workspace** — OAuth-based workspace connections with per-workspace isolation, usage limits, and cost controls.

**Self-Hosted** — Runs entirely on your infrastructure. Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, Redis. No data leaves your network.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zggf-zggf/openviktor.git
cd openviktor
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup script handles dependencies, database, and config. You'll need:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) >= 1.2
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) + Docker Compose
- A [Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps) with Socket Mode
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

<summary><strong>Manual setup</strong></summary>

```bash
bun install
cp docker/.env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
bun run db:generate
bun run db:migrate
bun run dev
```

</details>

> For production deployment, see the [Self-Hosting Guide](docs/self-hosting.md).
